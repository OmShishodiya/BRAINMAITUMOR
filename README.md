Project Overview
This AI/ML project is designed to classify brain tumor images into types using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The project includes a web-based interface for users to upload MRI images, which are then processed by the trained model to detect and identify the type of tumor.

Supported tumor types include:

Glioma
Meningioma
No Tumor
Pituitary Tumor
The goal of this project is to aid in quick and accurate diagnosis of brain tumors.

Features
Tumor Type Detection: Classifies uploaded MRI images into tumor types.
User-Friendly Interface: A web-based frontend allows users to upload images easily.
Real-Time Detection: After uploading, the system provides immediate results for tumor type.
Model Training Pipeline: Allows retraining the model with additional datasets.
Visualizations: Displays relevant metrics and visualizations of model performance.
Technologies Used
Backend:

TensorFlow: For building and training the neural network model.
OpenCV: For image processing and pre-processing tasks.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and handling.
Flask: For connecting the model with the frontend.
Frontend:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For creating a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Installation
To set up this project locally:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/OmShishodiya/Brain-Tumor-Detection.git
cd Brain-Tumor-Detection
Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask Application

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Open in Browser
Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the app.

Usage
Upload an Image: On the homepage, upload an MRI image.
Detection: The uploaded image is processed, and the detected tumor type is displayed.
Result: The result displays the predicted tumor type, with options to upload another image or retrain the model with new data.
Model Training
The model is a CNN built with TensorFlow. The dataset used for training includes labeled MRI images categorized by tumor types. You can train the model with additional data by adding images to the trainset/ folder, organized in subfolders by tumor type.

To retrain the model, run the training script (if available) or modify app.py to initiate training when new data is added.

Training Example (for a custom script)
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
